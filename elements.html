									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="" /></span>I have a passion for effective storytelling. Since discovering data science and its unique ability to describe the world around us, I have been engrossed in learning its many facets.  I have developed an aptitude for applying statistical knowledge through the power of computer programming to solve practical problems.<br><br>

I am currently in my final semester of a Masters of Data Analytics at RMIT University. Through coursework and personal projects I have gained a sound understanding of statistics, a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, and the Python programming language: Being an avid supporter of the English Football League, I built a classifier to predict the outcome of matches based on relevant statistics. This project, and others, have provided me with great knowledge into the world of data science and the many practical problems it can help solve.<br><br>

Aside from my discipline-specific knowledge, both prior to and during my degree I developed excellent communication skills through full time employment in the financial sector and working in the hospitality industry in Australia, Europe, Canada, and Japan. These experiences have given me the unique ability to work effectively within teams of people of varying age levels and backgrounds.<br><br>

In my downtime I enjoy participating in various physical activities and writing and playing music with friends throughout Melbourneâ€™s many music venues. I get a lot out of fulfillment out of the creative and collaborative process of writing music with close friends which I believe has taught me invaluable lessons in working well within a team.
